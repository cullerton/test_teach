Logging with Python
===================

Welcome to Logging with Python. This lesson breaks down into four parts:

**Background** establishes some motivation and introduces the concept of logging levels.

In **Logging**, we work with the basics and discover some of their limitations.

In **Test Teach**, we apply what we've learned to our class project.

In **More Logging**, we use the components of logging to customize it for our needs.
